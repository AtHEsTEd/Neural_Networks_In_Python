Neural networks in python, made by an A Level student
These are just made as a project to understand how neural networks work, so don't expect any good performance out of them, especially the convolutional layers, but feel free to have a look and use it
If you have any feedback it would be greatly appreciated

This code was heavily inspired by the Neural Networks From Scratch (NNFS) book, if you want to understand how neural networks work, I definitely recommed buying it
